### About

### How to Play
		
## Player
#### Level
Level of the player represents the "strength" of the player. 
Levels are gained through experience rewards. There is no **maximum** level allowing 
the game to be ever scaling. A level can directly effect the difficulty of the game 
as various mechanics may rely on it for their difficulty.
				
Experience can be gained through:
- Unlocking/Upgrading/Building Town Structures
- Gathering Resources
- Completing Missions/Orders

#### Blood Thirst Meter
The thirst meter represents the player's need to feed on human blood. 
A full meter is a full vampire while an empty meter is a **very thirsty** 
vampire. The consequence of an empty meter is the loss of citizen count 
equal to the vampire's level (**One towny loss per every player level**). 
The amount of blood needed **daily** also depends on the player's level where 10 units
of blood is needed per every level.
				
A level 20 vampire will need 200 units of blood to be sustained and will lose 20 townies upon an empty meter
				
*Fun Fact: The average human is around 10 units of blood (1.2-1.5 gallons) - American Red Cross*
	#### Inventory
The location for all of the player's resources excluding Blood and currency. 
Maximum allowed space depends entirely on the built structures in the player's
town. To increase the maximum allowed items in inventory, upgrading and purchasing 
Storage Facilities is required. The player initially starts at a maximum of **500**
items allowed in inventory. 
				
#### Currency
This is the driving force in upgrading the player's town. Currency allows the 
player to purchase structures, resources, items, and upgrades. The form of currency evolves 
alongside the town and it's technology. 
- Medieval Era: Coins
- Other Eras TBA
			
 #### Pizza
The player's main focus should be to make pizza to attract tourists to their town.
Pizzas can be made through resources gathered by town efforts. Pizza isn't an actual inventory
item but instead recipe lists and how many pizzas can be made with each. 
		
## Town 
### Attributes
#### Citizen Count
There are a number of citizens that belong to the Vampire Player's town. Building 
towny homes allows for citizens to move in to the town and contribute to 
the pizza making that the town is famous for. Each citizen in the player's town represents 
0.025x production speed on farm plots, and 
crafting stations
				
				
#### Technological Era</h4>
Vampires are immortal and thus live until they are are murdered. 
To incorporate this aspect in to the game, the player can experience different 
timelines where their upgrades, currency, structures, etc change with the current era. Some 
structures, resources, and upgrades are only unlocked through entering a new era.
